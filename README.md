# Memory Pool Allocator in C++

This repository contains a simple implementation of a memory pool 
allocator in C++. The memory pool is designed to manage memory allocations 
efficiently, reducing fragmentation and improving performance for 
applications that require frequent allocations and deallocations of 
objects of the same size.
